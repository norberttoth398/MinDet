### Processing 

All data processing related functions and capabilities of our software are present in this directory. The aim is to be able to automate much of the analysis done manually at the moment with more automated methods. These functions will be written in the point of view of someone trying to process the data gathered using our Deep Learning based methods for plagioclase detection.

However, note that these functions will be usable for anyone with their own datasets on any mineral for their own textural analysis.
